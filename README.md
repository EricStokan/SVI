This will select the social vulnerability indices, four individual items and the composite for each of the years 2000, 2010, and 2014.  It will also create change variables from 2000 to 2010, 2010 to 2014, and 2000 to 2014.  They will also be saved as T1_2000, T1_2010, T1_2014... and the total index is T_2000, T_2010, T_2014.  The Change variables are named T1_Ch1014 to reflect the change from 2010 to 2014 for example.

The Rmarkdown file if properly run will save a file called UpdatedSVItoMetro with these calculations.
